## Depot Ecommerce

## Project Purpose
 - The goal of this project is to build an e-commerce platform using Ruby on Rails, following agile development principles. It aims to showcase one of the most powerful aspects of the Rails     ecosystem: simplicity. In recent years, the developer community has seen a surge in new architectures and rigid guidelines about how things should or shouldn’t be done. However, Rails embraces a pragmatic and agile approach. This project is a tribute to that philosophy — building powerful applications without unnecessary complexity.
